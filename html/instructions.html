  <h1>Instructions of the Ultimatum Game. Please read them carefully</h1>
  <div id="instructions">
    This game is played in rounds by two human players randomly paired.
    <br><br>
    In each round, one of the them, called <em>BIDDER</em>, makes an offer to the other player,
    called <em>RESPONDENT</em>, about how to share 100 ECU (Experimental Currency). 100 ECU are equal to 0.10 USD.
    <br><br>
    The RESPONDENT can either accept or reject the offer of the BIDDER. 
    If he / she accepts, both players split the pot accordingly, else both get 0.
